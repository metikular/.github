## Hi there 👋

- We offer software consulting and the development of web applications, specialised on 💎 [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org). We focus on «sophisticated simplicity», i.e. software which is easy to use, but still sophisticated in the background.
- We strive for longterm maintainability of software. Code should be easy to read — less code is often better code, but [code golf](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com) is not.
- We support [Linux](https://archlinux.org) and open source software. We believe that software should be available to anyone and should be changed by anyone.
